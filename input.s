# for read() or write()
# %rax should contain a number of the syscall
#       read() syscall number is 0 in linux. 0x2000003 in macos.
#      write() syscall number is 1 in linux. 0x2000004 in macos.
# %rdi should contain a file descriptor.
#       stdin is 0, and stdout is 1
# %rsi shoud contain a buffer address (where to write the input, or where from output to console)
# %rdx should contain length of the buffer in bytes.

#exit() syscall number is 60 in linux. 0x2000001 in macos.

      mov   ?, %rax               # system call for exit
      # now, we want second character in the buffer to be
      # the return code of the program.
      # first character is (arr)
      # arr is a pointer, parentheses mean - get what is actually located
      # at that address.
      # so for the first character in the buffer we would do:
      # mov (arr), %rdi
      # but not only we need the second character
      # there is another problem:
      # before the comma we have a byte,
      # and after the comma we have a 64 bit register - i. e. 8 bytes.
      # we can use movb! but still, doesn't compile.
      # so how to move a byte in to that register?
      # a byte which is a second byte.
      movb  (arr), %rdi               # <--- CHANGE THIS
      syscall
